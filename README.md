(Replace with your project banner if available)

📌 Overview
SmartSanitize is a data cleaning and preprocessing tool designed to automate file validation, data quality checks, preprocessing, and reporting. It ensures high-quality, clean datasets for ML models, data analysis, and business intelligence.

✨ Features
A. File Upload & Validation
✅ Supports multiple file formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, etc.).
✅ Checks file structure and integrity.

B. Data Quality Analysis & Error Detection
✅ Detects missing values (Null count per column).
✅ Identifies & suggests duplicate removal.
✅ Checks for class imbalance in datasets.
✅ Anonymizes sensitive data (emails, names).

C. Data Preprocessing (User-Selectable Options)
✅ Missing Value Handling: Mean, Median, Mode, Drop Rows.
✅ Feature Scaling: Min-Max Scaling, Standardization.
✅ Feature Selection: Correlation-based, PCA.
✅ Data Augmentation: Synthetic data generation (SMOTE).

D. Data Visualization & Reporting
✅ Interactive charts for missing values & class distributions.
✅ Export cleaned datasets and reports in PDF & JSON formats.
